# Italian Linux Keyboard for Windows.

Finally, you can type characters like "È", "ß" and "©" from your italian keyboard, just like how you would on linux!
I literally copied the Linux layout and remade it entirely in the microsoft keyboard creation tool, so there's really not much to say about it. However here are some screenshots from GNOME explaining how the layout works.

If there's some difference between the two layouts, please feel free to report it so I can fix it straight away!
